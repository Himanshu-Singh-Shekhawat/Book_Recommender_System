# Book_Recommender_System
**➲ Project description**

Recommendation system is a type of system where we have to recommend similar books to the reader based on his interest. The system deals with a large volume of information by filtering the most important information based on the data provided by a user.

Mainly two approaches used in collaborative filtering :-

   1 - User based nearest-neighbour collaborative filtering.
   
   2 - Item based nearest-neighbour collaborative filtering.
     
   A recommender system, or a recommendation system, is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user 
would give to an item. They are primarily used in commercial applications. (source - Wikipedia)

Mainly three types of recommendation systems in machine learning based on filtering are used to suggest product and services to the consumers.

Content Filtering

Collaborative Filtering

Hybrid Filtering

Content Filtering:

In this algorithm, we try finding items look alike. Once we have item look like matrix,

we can easily recommend alike items to a customer, who has purchased any item from the store.

Collaborative Filtering:

Here, we try to search for look alike customers and offer products based on what his/her lookalike has chosen.

This algorithm is very effective but takes a lot of time and resources.

Hybrid Filtering (Content Filtering + Collaborative Filtering):

Both Content Filtering & Collaborative Filtering is used for the purpose. you-tube uses this algorithm for their strong recommendation system.

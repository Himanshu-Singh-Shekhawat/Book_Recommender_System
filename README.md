# Book_Recommender_System
**âž² Project description**

Recommendation system is a type of system where we have to recommend similar books to the reader based on his interest. The system deals with a large volume of information by filtering the most important information based on the data provided by a user.

Mainly two approaches used in collaborative filtering :-

   1 - User based nearest-neighbour collaborative filtering.
   
   2 - Item based nearest-neighbour collaborative filtering.
